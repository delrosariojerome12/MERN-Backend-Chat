# MERN-Backend-Chat

npm start for client and server.

server localhost://5001
clien localhost://3000

two problems, notifications is not working and user cannot see what other user sends in private messages. 
Sorry im new to full stack and need to learn more, i just started backend a literal a week ago. I mainly specialized frontend things.
